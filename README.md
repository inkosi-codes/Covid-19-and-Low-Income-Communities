## Overview
As the pandemic continues to obstruct our everyday lives we wait patiently longing to return to some sort of normalcy in our lives. The current situation has had an affect not just here in the US, but communities all around the world are still trying to grapple with a virus that has no boundaries and does not discriminate on race, gender, etc. We chose to do this analysis not only because it's a current world issue, but we wanted to see if we could identify

## Focus of our analysis

1. What was the affect of Covid-19 on low-income communities vs. the rest of the targeted population?
2. Was there any affect on unemployment claims during the Covid-19 Pandemic? 
3. Is there any correlation between different urbanized categories as a result of Covid-19?
